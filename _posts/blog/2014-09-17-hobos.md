For those who know me from my high school years, I used to say the word *hobo* a
lot. Like a lot.

> Why are you such a hobo?

or

> Stop being a hobo.

Along with my repetitive and meaningless use of the word *hobo*, I
often decided to sleep anywhere on the ground, similar to what a homeless
person might do.

That's me on the ground curled up on top of Julian's backpack. Two to three
times a week, you could find me snoring on the concrete. This would occur
so often that my friends would often do the following

aka post a wonderful photo of my new abode on my Facebook Timeline.

Now don't get me wrong, I have been fortunate to have a fantastic home during my
childhood years. I also never said any of these things to tease or poke fun at
homeless people either – all of these events just sort of happened. But these
relatively lighthearted incorporations of *hoboness* may have made me more aware
of the homelessness around me.

When I left the bubble of Cupertino to attend college at
[Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu), arguably another bubble of its own, I took the
newfound independence and freedom as an opportunity to explore the unknown. I
strolled through the ghetto of Los Angeles. I saw homeless people by the *dozens*,
not just my poor imitations. I met people who complained that they were starving
because they hadn't eaten for *days*. Hearing about the hunger, and seeing it
in front of one's eyes was a huge difference.

When I was younger, my family and I used to walk together at night often. Every
so often, a homeless person would approach us when we were near the 7-11 and ask
for some money. My dad would refuse and instead offer to buy him or her some
food. More often than not, the homeless individual would oblige and my dad
would buy some dinner. He would tell me afterward that he didn't give them money
because he didn't want the homeless person to spend the money on drugs, or other
life choices that wouldn't help their situation. I thought my dad was a hero,
providing warm meals to those in need (as if I needed another reason to view my
dad as my role model).

So when a homeless couple came up to me later that year, I did what the Jain
family had always done – give food. A couple of dollars at Subway well spent I
thought. But tears were welling up in their eyes. They hugged me later on, multiple times,
thanking me. It felt nice to help in some fashion, but I didn't feel
like a hero. Yet I didn't want to. Reflecting on the situation later on, I
rationalized that I would most likely encounter several more homeless
individuals who needed help.

I've been fortunate enough to live under a great
roof – enough for me to say *hobo* carelessly, but not everyone has. I've since
promised myself to provide to anyone and everyone that comes up to me, in the
safest manner possible. I haven't ever lived the *hobo* life but I sure can help
those who do daily. I challenge you to do the same.
